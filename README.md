# Hello Friends 
### This is my first css page I think I can write better css codes in the future. I think this page does not require much explanation as it is a very simple page. You can take a look at some of the code I wrote below.
HTML
```html
<div class="text1">
        <p><h1>Awesome Header</h1></p>
    </div>
    <div class="text2">
        <p><h2>Smaller Awesome Header</h2></p>
    </div>
    <div class="text3">
        <p>Evan Smaller Awesome Header</p>
    </div>
```
CSS
```css
.text1{
    color:white;
    background-color: black;
    text-decoration: underline;
    font-size:25px;
    text-align: center;
}
```
